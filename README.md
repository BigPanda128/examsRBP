Ryan Postma portion of exam code. I am editing the true and false functionality of the exam. My idea is to at first pull each question individually nd have the user answer them and to store the answers into an array. Then jsut print the array of answers to see waht they got right and wrong. After i get hte logic for that down pat, i want to make it so that it randomizes the questions that are asked.
